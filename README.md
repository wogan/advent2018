# Advent of Code 2018

My (slow) progress through [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'm using Scala with minimal dependencies, mainly just [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/)
and am trying to solve problems in (close to) idiomatic functional programming ways (no mutable state, etc).

Performance is a secondary concern, so long as solutions compelete in a few seconds I'm generally not worried.
